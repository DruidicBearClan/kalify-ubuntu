This is my Kalify-Ubuntu script.

This script when finished install the majority of the useful Kali linux tools and some other essentials on your Ubuntu. This script is a work in progress and far from finished.
Designed to run on a clean install of Ubuntu, recommended for the minimal installation with third-party drivers.
